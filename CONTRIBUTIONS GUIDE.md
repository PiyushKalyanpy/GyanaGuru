### Firebase (auth api key error) - Solution 
To resolve the Firebase error "Invalid API Key Auth", you have to create your own Firebase environment endpoints.

Please follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Firebase Environment
- Create a Firebase project on the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Set up the necessary Firebase services (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, etc.) for your project.

### 2. Retrieve Firebase Configuration
- In the Firebase console, navigate to your project settings.
- Go to the "General" tab, and scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
- Select the appropriate web app and click on the "Config" button to view the Firebase configuration object.
- Copy the api keys and paste into the project.
- Update the values in the configuration file with your own Firebase project's configuration information retrieved in the previous step.

```javascript
// firebase-config.js

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not push your api keys and firebase files in pull request, and if the pull request does not adhere to our contribution guidelines, it may be closed or discarded.
If you find any problem after that regarding firebase please ask in discord channel or in [discussion tab](https://github.com/PiyushKalyanpy/GyanaGuru/discussions/54)

Congratulations! You have successfully connected your own Firebase environment endpoints to the project. Your changes will be reviewed, and once approved, they will be merged into the original codebase.
